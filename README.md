# 2026: 11 Top-Tier AI-Powered Creative Analytics Tools You Must Know

Scrolling through ad manager dashboards trying to figure out which creatives actually drive sales feels like reading tea leaves. You see spend numbers, impressions, clicks—but connecting those metrics to specific creative elements that make ads convert requires hours of manual tagging, spreadsheet wrangling, and guesswork. AI-powered creative analytics platforms automate this entire workflow by analyzing your ads frame-by-frame, identifying winning patterns across formats and audiences, and telling you exactly what to test next based on your brand's actual performance data.

Segwise helps mobile game studios, DTC brands, subscription apps, and performance marketing agencies understand exactly which creative elements drive performance across Meta, TikTok, Google, AppLovin, and other major networks. Instead of focusing only on campaign-level metrics, the platform delivers creative-level intelligence by automatically tagging hooks, CTAs, characters, emotions, visual styles, audio components, and messaging patterns using multimodal AI.

The unified dashboard connects ad networks and MMPs into one view, eliminating manual spreadsheet consolidation and enabling cross-platform creative analysis. Teams can track ROAS, CPI, CTR, CVR, spend, and custom events by creative tag, making it clear which variables actually influence growth.

**Multimodal AI tagging** analyzes video, audio, image, text, and playable ads, mapping every tag directly to performance outcomes. This enables teams to identify scalable creative patterns, detect fatigue early, compare asset treatments through clustering, and generate new variations informed by real performance data rather than intuition.

Competitor creative tracking (currently across Meta) applies the same tagging system to rival ads, helping teams identify saturated angles and uncover white-space opportunities.
